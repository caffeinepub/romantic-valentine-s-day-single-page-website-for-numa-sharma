  "summary": "The diff implements both requirements. REQ-1 is satisfied: both uploaded photos (IMG_20260221_145437.jpg and IMG_20260221_145437-1.jpg) are added to the galleryImages array with proper paths (/assets/) and alt text. REQ-2 is satisfied: the gallery uses a responsive grid layout (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4) that displays all 12 photos in an organized manner, and the existing staggered fade-in animation pattern is preserved through the FramedGalleryImage component with index-based delays. However, physical file placement in frontend/public/assets/ cannot be verified from the diff, which only shows code changes.",

      "reason": "The diff shows code referencing /assets/ paths for the new photos, but does not show the actual image files being added to frontend/public/assets/. The ADDED FILES section shows 'none', suggesting the physical image files may not have been placed in the required location.",
