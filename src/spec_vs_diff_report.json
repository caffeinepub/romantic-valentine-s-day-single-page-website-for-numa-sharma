  "summary": "GallerySection.tsx was updated to include two new gallery image entries with English alt text and still renders via the existing FramedGalleryImage component. However, the actual uploaded image files were not added as static assets in the diff, so stable runtime URLs/no-broken-images cannot be confirmed.",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Both uploaded image files are added to the frontend as static assets and are accessible via stable URLs at runtime (no broken images in production build).",
      "reason": "The diff shows GallerySection referencing the two JPEGs under /assets/, but the change set reports no added files, so the uploaded images themselves do not appear to have been committed as static assets.",
      "evidence": [
